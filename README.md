### Explanation:
- I used **bold styling** around directory paths and file names to match the consistency of the previous styling.
- Bullet points are used to keep sections organized and easy to follow.
- Each section title has an emoji and is formatted similarly to ensure it looks visually cohesive.

Let me know if you'd like any more adjustments!
